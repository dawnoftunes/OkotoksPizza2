        <p><i>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
            flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
            and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, 
            traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</i></p>
